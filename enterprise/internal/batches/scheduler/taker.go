// taker wraps the Take() method provided by schedules to return a stream of
// messages indicating when a changeset should be scheduled. The scheduler can
// optionally ask the taker to delay the next Take() call if no changesets were ready
// when consuming the last message: this is important to avoid a busy-wait loop.
//
// Note that taker does not check the validity period of the schedule it is
// given; the caller should do this and stop the taker if the schedule expires
// or the configuration updates.
//
// It is important that the caller calls stop() when the taker is no longer in
// use, otherwise a goroutine, channel, and probably a rate limiter will be
// leaked.

	// If nil is sent over this channel, an error occurred, and this taker must
	// be stopped and discarded immediately.
