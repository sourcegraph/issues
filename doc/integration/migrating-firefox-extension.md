# Firefox Migration from self-hosted to Add-ons Store

We've recently migrated from hosting the Sourcegraph Firefox extension ourselves to hosting it in the Firefox add-ons store, to improve the update process.

If you previously installed the Firefox extension from our website, we recommend reinstalling the extension. Reinstalling the Sourcegraph Firefox extension is very easy. You can remove your current Sourcegraph extension by right-clicking the Sourcegraph logo and selecting "Remove Extension" from the dropdown. Once removed, you can navigate to the [Sourcegraph extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sourcegraph-for-firefox/) on the Firefox add-ons store and install the latest extension.
