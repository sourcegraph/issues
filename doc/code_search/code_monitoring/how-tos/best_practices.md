## Best practices

### Privacy and visibility
## Do not include confidential information in monitor names

Every code monitor has a name that will be shown whenever the monitor is referenced. In notification actions this name is likely to be the only information about the event, so it’s important for identfiying what was triggered, but also has to be “safe” to expose in plain text emails.
