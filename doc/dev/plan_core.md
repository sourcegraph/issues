**Theme**: What will break with 80k repositories across multiple code hosts?

**Q4 Vision Statement**: Sourcegraph operations are fast (e.g. search), instances scale to 80k repositories, private code is secure and respects ACLs for every authorization provider, and the product settings are easy to set up and understand for our largest customers.

#### Roadmap

Roadmap items may take more than an iteration to implement. As such please link to an issue which is scoped to this iteration. IE the issue should be closed at the end of the iteration.

All issues listed need to have a number of days estimate attached. When setting days, try and overestimate the time needed. Do not use a granularity less than a day. The total amount of work assigned to you needs to be about 75% of your available days.
