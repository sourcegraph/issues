_This is a template for proposals._

# [Title]

[A very brief explanation of this proposal.]

## Background

[A description of the problem that this proposal addresses along with any other relevant context.]

## Proposal

[A precise statement of the proposed change.]

### Test plan

[A description of how the proposal will be tested in an automated way.]

### Release plan

[A description of how the proposal will be released to users (e.g. feature flags, automatic data migrations, etc.).]

## Rationale

[A discussion of alternate approaches and the trade offs, advantages, and disadvantages (including risks and uncertainties) of the specified approach.]

## Checklist

[An ordered checklist that enumerates exactly what needs to be done, and target dates for each item. The average engineer should be able to follow this checklist and end up with the desired result.]

## Done date

[The date that all goals of the project will be accomplished. This is a firm commitment that we can communicate to anyone (e.g. internal team, external customers). As such, the date should account for all factors that could impact the it (including, but not limited to, necessary refactoring, writing automated tests, fixing bugs discovered, etc.), discounting by probability. Once approved, this date cannot be moved without agreement from the project approvers. If a project is ever at risk of not hitting the planned date, the project owner should immediately bring this to the attention of the approvers and also do whatever work is necessary to bring the project back on schedule. Descoping is generally preferred to moving the date. If the date needs to be moved, it is better to move it early in the project's lifecycle, so prioritize work that gives you more information about the remaining work first.]

## Retrospective

[This section is completed after the project is completely done (i.e. the checklist is complete).]

### Actual checklist

[What is the actual checklist the you completed (i.e. paste the final checklist from the issue here)? Explain any differences from the original checklist in the proposal.]

### Actual done date

[What is the date that the project was actually finished? Explain why this is earlier or later than originally planned or explain why the project was not completed.]
