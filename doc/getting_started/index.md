Welcome to our getting started guide, where we'll take you step-by-step through the most critical aspects of installing, configuring, and using Sourcegraph. But first, what is Sourcegraph?

## What is Sourcegraph?

Sourcegraph provides [Universal Code Search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/universal-code-search), which enables you to explore, navigate, and better understand all code, faster, with [contextual code intelligence](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/code-intelligence) to improve developer productivity, and [code change management](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/code-change-management) to make large-scale automated changes.
