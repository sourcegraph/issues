# Introduction to Sourcegraph Universal Code Search

If you've followed our guides this far, you've [chosen the right deployment model](choosing_the_right_deployment_model.md), [installed Sourcegraph](installing_sourcegraph.md), [connected and integrated your code host](connecting_integrating_your_code_host.md), and now, you're ready to begin using Sourcegraph Universal Code Search!

If you haven't used a code search tool previously, it may not be obvious how to get started, so first, we'll explain what Universal Code Search is, then demonstrate how to use Sourcegraph with an in-depth tour.

## What is Sourcegraph Universal Code Search?

Universal Code Search is unique to Sourcegraph, providing capabilities beyond what your editor and code host can offer.

Sourcegraph is your vehicle for searching, exploring, and navigating across your entire universe of code, meaning every codebase in your organization. Code search must be universal to be effective, as it's no longer feasible for individual developers to download and search all code locally. While your code host provides code search, it's minimal and not universal, as search is limited to only the repositories on that code host.

In concrete terms, Universal Code Search:

- Provides [exact string (literal)](../user/search/queries.md#literal-search-default), [regexp](../user/search/queries.md#regexp-search), and (new) [structural search](../user/search/queries.md#structural-search) query syntax
- Supports [every Git](../admin/external_service.md) and [non-Git](../admin/external_service/non-git.md) code host through either native integrations or custom solutions
- Searches in every repository from multiple code hosts simultaneously
- Searches in any repository branch
- Searches not just code, but commit diffs, and commit messages
- Provides fast and precise [code intelligence for every popular language](../user/code_intelligence.md)
- Providing [integrations](../integration/index.md) for everywhere you read and write code (editors, IDEs, code hosts)
- Provides a variety of [deployment options](../admin/install/index.md) to operate at massive scale, e.g., 40,000+ repositories
- Integrates [data and insights from external developer tools](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A%22External+services%22) when reviewing code, such as [code coverage overlays](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/codecov)

Now that you know what Universal Code Search is, let's show you how to use it.

## Introduction to using Sourcegraph

This video will show you how to build a search query step-by-step and customize the Sourcegraph UI with custom search filters and [saved searches](../user/search/saved_searches.md).

Now that you're well acquainted with the Sourcegraph UI and constructing search queries, let's dive deeper into the different search modes to understand when you should use one over the other.
