# Choosing the right deployment model for Sourcegraph

You don't have to be a Systems Administrator or DevOps Engineer to run Sourcegraph, just access to a machine with Docker installed.

It's free to deploy for up to 10 monthly users (great for trialing with your team), and you can unlock access to all enterprise features by [requesting a trial enterprise license key](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/request-demo/?form_submission_source=guides).

There are three ways of deploying Sourcegraph:

- **[Single Docker container](../admin/install/docker.md)**<br/>
Single container on a single host. Great for trying Sourcegraph locally or deploying for your team or company if only indexing a few hundred repositories.

- **[Docker Compose](../admin/install/docker-compose.md)**<br />
Individual Sourcegraph services on a single host. Best fit for companies with many hundreds or a thousand plus repositories and dozens of monthly users. Enables per-service resource allocation and service replicas to tune and meet load requirements. Perfect for demanding workloads with a relatively simple scaling model.

- **[Kubernetes cluster](../admin/install/cluster.md)**<br/>
Handles the most demanding of deployments from thousands to tens of thousands of repositories. In most instances, it's preferable to start with Docker Compose on a single powerful instance, then deploy to a Kubernetes cluster as part of an official enterprise trial.

See the [installing Sourcegraph page](../admin/index.md) for more information.

> NOTE: Still not sure which way to go? Our deployment engineering team can guide you in which deployment option is best. Just [request a demo](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/request-demo/?form_submission_source=guides&utm_source=guides) to discuss your specific requirements.

## Using the Sourcegraph resource estimator

You can also use the [Sourcegraph resource estimator](../admin/install/resource_estimator.md) to dial-in the specifics of your environment in order to get precise deployment recommendations.
