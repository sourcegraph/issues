# Code host and repository permissions in campaigns

All actions on the code host (such as pushing a branch or opening a changeset) are performed using the access token Sourcegraph is configured to use, but with the permissions of the user applying the campaign. For more information, see [Code host interactions in campaigns](managing_access.md#code-host-interactions-in-campaigns).

[Repository permissions](../../admin/repo/permissions.md) are enforced when campaigns display information. For more information, see [Repository permissions in campaigns](managing_access.md#repository-permissions-for-campaigns).
