# Site admin configuration for campaigns

Using campaigns requires a [code host connection](../../admin/external_service/index.md) to a supported code host (currently GitHub, Bitbucket Server, and GitLab).

Site admins can also:

- [Allow users to authenticate via the code host](../../admin/auth/index.md#github), which makes it easier for users to authorize [code host interactions in campaigns](managing_access.md#code-host-interactions-in-campaigns).
- [Configure repository permissions](../../admin/repo/permissions.md), which campaigns will respect.
- [Disable campaigns for all users](managing_access.md#disabling-campaigns-for-all-users).
