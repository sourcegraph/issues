# Contributing

## What contributions are accepted?

In short, we are open to nearly all contributions! We love feedback in all forms, issues, comments, PRs, etc!

Unless you feel confident your change will be accepted (trivial bug fixes, code cleanup, etc) you should first create an issue to discuss your change with us. In this way, we can help ensure that the approach taken is correct and that a minimal amount of your time will be wasted writing e.g. an incorrect implementation.

> [1] Exception: If you contribute functionality that already exists as a [paid Sourcegraph feature](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/), we are unlikely to accept it. Consult us beforehand for a definitive answer. (We'll add more details about the process here, and they'll be similar to [GitLab's stewardship principles](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/#contributing-an-existing-ee-feature-to-ce).)

## Code of Conduct

All interactions with the Sourcegraph open source project are governed by the
[Sourcegraph Code of Conduct](./docs/conduct.md).
