# Contributing

## What contributions are accepted?

In short, we are open to nearly all contributions! We love feedback in all forms, issues, comments, PRs, etc!

For larger changes (things other than trivial bug fixes, code cleanup, etc.), we recommend you [write a Sourcegraph RFC](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/communication/rfcs#external-contributors). This lets us all discuss the design and implementation of your change, which helps ensure your time is well spent and that your contribution will be accepted.

> Exception: If you contribute functionality that already exists as a [paid Sourcegraph feature](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/), we are unlikely to accept it. Consult us beforehand for a definitive answer. (We'll add more details about the process here, and they'll be similar to [GitLab's stewardship principles](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/#contributing-an-existing-ee-feature-to-ce).)

## Code of Conduct

All interactions with the Sourcegraph open source project are governed by the
[Sourcegraph Code of Conduct](./doc/dev/conduct.md).
