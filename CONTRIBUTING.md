# Contributing

## What contributions are accepted?

In short, we are open to all contibutions! We love feedback in all forms, issues, comments, PRs, etc!

If you have a very large change in mind, it may be better to first create an issue to discuss it with us to make sure it is being tackled with the right approach (otherwise you may waste your time implementing something we can't merge).

## Code of Conduct

All interactions with the Sourcegraph open source project are governed by the
[Sourcegraph Code of Conduct](./docs/conduct.md).
