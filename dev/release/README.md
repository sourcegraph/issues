# Sourcegraph release tool

This directory contains scripts and code to automate our releases. Run `yarn run release` to see a list of automated steps. Refer to [the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/releases) for details on our release processes.

Run `yarn run build` to build the tool (*required* alongside `yarn run release` to make sure you are using the latest version of the tool), and `yarn run watch` to build on any changes to files.
